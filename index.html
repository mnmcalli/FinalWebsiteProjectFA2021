            <p>PlayStation offers next-generation consoles that rival other competitors like XBox. The relatively new PS5 has many new features compared to the older consoles, such as a newly refurbished user interface and special controllers that can be set to have different resistances for actions like pulling the trigger to a gun in Call of Duty. This console was released at the end of last year and continues to be a popular console. All consoles feature button map and UI customization to make every user comfortable with the layout.</p>
