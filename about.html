            <p>Sony owns PlayStation. Sony is a Japan-based company that specializes in technology. They make televisions, DVD players, gaming consoles, and, of course, release video games for their consoles. They've pioneered audio technology, visual technology, and interactive technology. It's categorized as a multinational conglomerate, which means that it both has reputation and stakes in various nations, as well as being in many different industries. Sony does business in the technology industry, the music industry, and the film industry.</p>

            <p>Sony didn't always have a large stake in the video gaming industry. Sony used to make small parts for other companies, such as Nintendo for their consoles. Eventually, Sony broke off its agreement with Nintendo and decided to get into the video game industry. Sony always made it a priority to use technology they were already familiar with, making their gaming disks much like DVDs (unlike Nintendo, which developed their own game cards for each console). Though the consoles have been pretty stable in price, the most recent PS4 and PS5 are more expensive.</p>
